# moov-io/metro2

Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease-of-use.

Metro2 implements a reader, writer, and validator for consumer credit history reports in an HTTP server and Go library. The HTTP server is available in a [Docker image](#docker) and the Go package `github.com/moov-io/metro2` is available.

## Project status

Moov Metro2 is actively used in multiple production environments. Please star the project if you are interested in its progress. If you have layers above Metro2 to simplify tasks, perform business operations, or found bugs we would appreciate an issue or pull request. Thanks!

## Usage

The Metro2 project implements an HTTP server and [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/metro2) for creating and modifying files in Metro 2 format, which is used for consumer credit history reporting by U.S. credit bureaus.

### Docker

We publish a [public Docker image `moov/metro2`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/metro2/) on Docker Hub with each tagged release of Metro2. No configuration is required to serve on `:8080`. We also have Docker images for [OpenShift](https://quay.io/repository/moov/metro2?tab=tags) published as `quay.io/moov/metro2`.

Pull & start the Docker image:
```
docker pull moov/metro2:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 moov/metro2:latest
```

Upload a file and validate it:
```
curl -X POST --form "file=@./test/testdata/packed_file.json" http://localhost:8080/validator
```
```
valid file
```

Convert a file from JSON to raw Metro format:
```
curl -X POST --form "file=@./test/testdata/packed_file.json" --form "format=metro" http://localhost:8080/convert
```
```

```

### Google Cloud Run

To get started in a hosted environment you can deploy this project to the Google Cloud Platform.

From your [Google Cloud dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) create a new project and call it:
```
moov-metro2-demo
```

Enable the [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) API for your project and associate a [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account) if needed. Then, open the Cloud Shell terminal and run the following Docker commands, substituting your unique project ID:

```
docker pull moov/metro2
docker tag moov/metro2 gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/metro2
docker push gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/metro2
```

Deploy the container to Cloud Run:
```
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/metro2 --port 8080
```

Select your target platform to `1`, service name to `metro2`, and region to the one closest to you (enable Google API service if a prompt appears). Upon a successful build you will be given a URL where the API has been deployed:

```
https://YOUR-METRO2-APP-URL.a.run.app
```

Now you can complete a health check:
```
curl https://YOUR-METRO2-APP-URL.a.run.app/health
```
You should get this response:
```
{"health":true}
```

### Data persistence
By design, Metro2  **does not persist** (save) any data about the files or entry details created. The only storage occurs in memory of the process and upon restart Metro2 will have no files or data saved. Also, no in-memory encryption of the data is performed.

### Go library

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go v1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/metro2/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

```
$ git@github.com:moov-io/metro2.git

# Pull down into the Go Module cache
$ go get -u github.com/moov-io/metro2

$ go doc github.com/moov-io/metro2
```

### Command line

Metro2 has a command line interface to manage Metro 2 files and launch a web service.

```
metro2 --help

Usage:
   [command]

Available Commands:
  convert     Convert metro file format
  help        Help about any command
  print       Print metro file
  validator   Validate metro file
  web         Launches web server

Flags:
  -h, --help           help for this command
      --input string   input file (default is $PWD/metro.json)

Use " [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Each interaction that the library supports is exposed in a command-line option:

 Command | Info
 ------- | -------
`convert` | The convert command allows users to convert a metro file to a specified file format (json, metro). The result will create a new file.
`print` | The print command allows users to print a metro file in a specified file format (json, metro).
`validator` | The validator command allows users to validate a metro file.
`web` | The web command will launch a web server with endpoints to manage metro files.

## Contributing

Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started!

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go v1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/metro2/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

### Releasing

To make a release of metro2 simply open a pull request with `CHANGELOG.md` and `version.go` updated with the next version number and details. You'll also need to push the tag (i.e. `git push origin v1.0.0`) to origin in order for CI to make the release.

### Testing

We maintain a comprehensive suite of unit tests and recommend table-driven testing when a particular function warrants several very similar test cases. To run all test files in the current directory, use `go test`. Current overall coverage can be found on [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/moov-io/metro2/).

### Fuzzing

We currently run fuzzing over ImageCashLetter in the form of a [`moov/metro2`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/metro2fuzz) Docker image. You can [read more](./test/fuzz-reader/README.md) or run the image and report crasher examples to [`security@moov.io`](mailto:security@moov.io). Thanks!
