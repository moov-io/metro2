# File Structure

A Metro 2 credit reporting file consists of a single Header Record, Data Record, and Trailer Record. The Data Record includes a Base Segment followed by several optional appended segments. There can be multiple occurences of an optional segment type as needed, except for L1. The Header Record, Base Segment, and Trailer Record can be in either unpacked (character) or packed format, while the optional segments must be unpacked.

Unpacked format for header, base, and trailer segments is a 426 byte sequence that's fixed or variable blocked. Packed format is a 366 byte sequence that's variable blocked. Unpacked format is heavily preferred for electronic transmission.

The following reporting standards apply to all Metro 2 data:

- File names cannot have special characters or whitespace
- Every alphanumeric field must be left-justified and blank filled
- Every alpha field must be uppercase
- If a descriptive field is not available, it should be blank filled
- If a numeric or monetary field is not available, it should be zero filled
- Monetary fields must be reported in whole dollars, with cents truncated
- If fixed-length records are being reported and a record doesn't require the information for an optional appendage segment, the Segment Identifier (e.g., J1) must still be reported and the remainder of the segment must be blank filled

The chart below describes each segment in detail, and segments must occur in the order listed:
