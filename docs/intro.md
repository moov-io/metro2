# What is Metro 2?

Metro 2 is a data specification created by the Consumer Data Industry Association for credit reporting data furnishers (who are members of the credit bureau with a data furnishing service agreement) to report consumers' credit history information to major credit bureaus electronically and in a standardized format. It is implemented in credit reporting software packages. The specification is extensive and is designed to standardize a wide range of credit history information while complying with federal laws and regulations in credit reporting (such as accommodating consumer disputes and disputed status of information).
